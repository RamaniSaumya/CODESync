# What project is about ? ?

The project is mainly based on the idea of "Working Together".
It enables users to create rooms as per their convenience and can invite multiple users to their room so that they can work on their project together. 

## Tech Stack.

The tech stack of the project is relatively simpler one because it uses REACT.JS for the frontend, normal CSS for beautifcation and for concurrency, socket programming is used.
Now socket programming can be used through many ways, but here I have used the SOCKET.IO framework of NODE.JS that supports the functionalities such as creating socket, its references, passing the code to the sockets, etc...
